# Global Tech Layoffs Analysis (2020–2023)  
**SQL Data Cleaning + Exploratory Data Analysis + Business Insights**

## 📊 Project Overview
This project performs a **full data analysis pipeline** on real-world layoff data from 2020–2023. It demonstrates:

- Cleaning messy real-world data using MySQL
- Exploratory data analysis with insightful SQL queries
- Deriving actionable business insights about the post-pandemic downturn across industries

**Key Finding**: Layoffs surged over **600%** from 2021 to 2022, peaking in late 2022, driven by over-hiring during the pandemic.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- **MySQL** (CTEs, window functions, data type conversion, joins)
- Data Cleaning (duplicates, standardization, missing values)
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Storytelling with data

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Top 3 Companies**: Amazon (27K+), Meta (21K), Google (12K)
- **Most Affected Industries**: Consumer, Retail, Transportation
- **Geography**: ~70% of layoffs in the United States
- **Trend**: Massive spike in 2022–2023 after low layoffs in 2021
- **Funding Stage**: Post-IPO companies had largest absolute cuts; startups had higher % reductions

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Build interactive Tableau or Power BI dashboard (in progress)
- Predict future layoffs using time-series models
- Expand dataset with 2024-2025 layofffs to track ongoing trends
